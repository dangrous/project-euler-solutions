Don't look at these if you haven't solved the puzzles!

I will be updating this folder as I solve the puzzles, and I will be also updating the code to be more user-friendly.

Generally, I am trying to write these not just to get the particular, hard-coded answer that the puzzle is looking for, but rather to create a toolbox that can be used at any point.

Also, I'm writing in Python to start.
